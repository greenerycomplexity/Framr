## What is it?

**Framr** is a video frame grabber app that lets you capture and save your favorite moments from any video as high-quality images, instead of relying on manually taking screenshots.

## Features
- **Scrollable Frame-by-frame picker wheel**: Scroll through individual frames with haptic feedback for an intuitive experience
- **Direct iOS Photos Library integration**: Import any video from, and export frames straight to your iOS Photos gallery
- **No quality loss**: Unlike screenshots, Framr extracts frames directly from the video source without compression artifacts
- **Pinch-to-zoom**: Inspect frames in detail with smooth 2-finger pinch and pan gestures

- **AVFoundation**: Handles video playback, frame extraction, and media processing
- **Photos & PhotosUI**: Manages photo library access and video import/export
- **UIKit**: Powers advanced gesture recognition for the zoomable video player
